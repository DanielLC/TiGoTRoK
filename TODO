This is a checklist of things that need to be done. Feel free to add or remove things from it as you see fit.

-----

Draw Kanae Sprite

Create non-shitty energy net effect.


Need a few more sound effects during the first part of the AO prologue fight.

Kyon talking to Yuki and the "I am John Smith" scenes could probably use some general polish.

Chapter title cards and date cards for scene switches.

Design an awesome K:BDH logo.

Start directing Chapter 2. (Gentlemen: Where we're going, we're going to need a lot more sprites.)
