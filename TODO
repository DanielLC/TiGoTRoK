This is a checklist of things that need to be done. Feel free to add or remove things from it as you see fit.

-----

Draw Kanae Sprite
Create non-shitty energy net effect.
Direct the last three scenes of Chapter 1
Need a few more sound effects during the first part of the AO prologue fight.
Kyon talking to Yuki and the "I am John Smith" scenes could probably use some general polish.
Chapter title cards and date cards for scene switches.
