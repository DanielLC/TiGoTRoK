This is a checklist of things that need to be done. Feel free to add or remove things from it as you see fit.

Moar Kanae expressions!

Create non-shitty energy net effect.

Need a few more sound effects during the first part of the AO prologue fight.

Kyon talking to Yuki and the "I am John Smith" scenes could probably use some general polish.

Chapter title cards and date cards for scene switches.

Design an awesome K:BDH logo.

Continue directing Chapter 2. (If someone wants me to cut out a Mikuru(Big) template for both of her poses, that would be swell.)

How to use the code:

For starters, you need Ren'Py, the visual novel engine that's used. That's an
easy download and install; put it wherever. On your first run of Ren'Py, or
thereafter through the Options screen, it asks you to select a project
directory. Pick an empty directory somewhere, then put the directory containing
this file—probably 'KBDH-VN'—into that empty directory. After that, you should
be able to click 'Select Project' from the Ren'Py main menu and select
'KBDH-VN'.

After selecting the project, you can launch it or edit it from the Ren'Py
menu. I personally use a separate editor, but Ren'Py comes with jEdit, which is
serviceable. The specifics of the Ren'Py language are available on their web
site. Regarding music and images...that's not my department. :P They'll fit in
the repository fine, but editing them is something that the people doing it will
know better than me.

Good luck, all.
