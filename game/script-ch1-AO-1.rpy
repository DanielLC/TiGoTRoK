    "\"Chapter One: The Truth is the Greatest Weapon\"\n\n\"...of dozens of issues with maintaining a 'masquerade' scenario. Generally, unless it's absolutely required, it's a bad idea. There will be fallout. If it must be done, the truth is still going to be the ultimate weapon � plan accordingly, and make sure it's a weapon that will serve you, and not any enemies. Barring that, make fast friends with someone who can BS better than you.\"\n\n\"Cover\" � Author Unknown"

    "That day had started normally enough, but then, in his experience, that was true of nearly all days. This had caused him to become naturally suspicious of every day, to the point where he was starting to suspect a slow but sure slide into absolute paranoia. Haruhi was taking her toll on him ... even if she was calming down, her behavior after that horrific (in retrospect) run-in with Sasaki was doing absolutely nothing to soothe him."
    nvl clear
    "His preferred refuge from total madness was quite simple: Drink some milk."
    "He didn't know why it had such a calming, reassuring effect on him, but it did. So he poured himself a large glass in the kitchen, one ear perking up and catching the sounds of his sister playing a video game in the living room. Damn it, he thought. He'd even left his cell in the other room specifically to lay a claim on the system!"
    nvl clear
    "Seriously, he thought darkly, taking a large swallow of his milk, the system was a Playstation Two � about ten years out of date now, and he had to haul it all the way upstairs if he wanted to play games in his room. He probably shouldn't even bother getting worked up about such an antiquated gaming system. Even if it was the only gaming system in the house. His phone rang and he sighed, rolling his eyes but staying in the kitchen."
    nvl clear
    "\"Kyon-kun,\" his sister called, pausing the game with a loud chirp, \"phone!\""
    "He lowered his glass, already able to anticipate Haruhi demanding his participation in something. \"Answer it for me,\" he called back between gulps. \"I'm busy.\""
    "\"Okaaaaaay,\" she said, before he heard her say, \"Kyon-kun's phone! He's too lazy to answer!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Thanks,\" he muttered under his breath."
    "\"Oh? Okay! I'll tell him. Feel better!\" Then her voice rose from conversational, to an unnecessary bellow, \"Kyon-kun! Yuki-nee-san says she's sick and really wants you to visit her!\""
    "He didn't even bother to grab the phone on the way out."
    "\"Can I come with...\" she began, before the door slammed shut. Shrugging, she turned back to the game after flipping Kyon's phone closed."
    nvl clear
    "He calculated the ride to Nagato's place as a twenty minute trip, at one point. When he reached the lobby, barely pausing long enough to lock up his bike, he wondered if he'd beaten his best time, but didn't feel the need to check. Instead, he dashed to the console, still gasping for breath, and fumbled, mis-dialing her room number and needing to hammer the 'cancel' button to dial again. \"Nagato!\" he called, the second she picked up. \"It's me!\""
    "The door opened."
    "After taking the elevator to her floor, he slowed his mad pace, seeing her standing outside the doorway to her apartment, waiting for him. He tried to imagine that he saw some relief around her eyes when he reached her side, but wasn't confident enough to be certain that was the case. \"Nagato,\" he said, nodding. \"What's wrong?\""
    "She gestured him inside, leading him to the table. He kicked off his shoes and went to the kotatsu, watching her warily."
    nvl clear
    "After pouring a cup of tea for each of them in silence, she finally spoke. \"The Integrated Data Sentience Entity has determined that I have become a liability,\" she said in a soft monotone, nearly devoid of inflection."
    "He stared at her for a long minute, blinking. \"What ... do you mean?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Factors within my makeup have become too unpredictable. It has been calculated that I will commit another error. To prevent this, deletion has been scheduled in three hours, twenty one minutes, fifteen seconds; I will be replaced with an interface more suited to defending against possible Sky Canopy Domain interference.\""
    nvl clear
    "After taking a deep breath, he growled, \"There isn't enough milk in the world.\""
    "She blinked several times in response."
    "\"How set is this?\" he asked, his hands shaking too much to hold the teacup properly."
    "\"It is absolute.\""
    nvl clear
    "He took another deep breath, then jumped to his feet, nearly upsetting the table, and began pacing back and forth in her living room. She watched him silently. \"Okay,\" he said, after a moment of thought. \"I'll just�\" He broke off, fumbling at his pocket when he realized his phone was still at home. Biting off a curse, he asked, \"Can I use your phone, Nagato? I need to call Haruhi and the others.\""
    nvl clear
    "For a moment, mild disappointment flickered around her eyes. \"It is not necessary.\""
    "He stared at her, then shook his head. \"What do you mean?\""
    "\"I requested your presence for ... personal reasons,\" she said. \"It was not a request for help.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I don't care!\" he shouted. \"I've always relied on you � now that you need help, I am not going to just stand by and watch you get taken away from� from us!\""
    "She blinked, considering, then lowered her head slightly in her infinitesimal nod. \"I see,\" she said quietly."
    nvl clear
    "\"So, I need to make some phone calls.\""
    "\"Understood.\""

    "She couldn't imagine what had possessed Kyon to call her, ranting like a lunatic about Yuki being sick. But he'd done it from her phone, which meant for whatever reason that he and Yuki were alone together. She wasn't certain why that bothered her, but it did � so when he demanded her presence, instead of telling him what he could do for trying to order the Brigade leader around, she swore that she'd be there."
    nvl clear
    "After trekking all the way there, much to her annoyance, she found that she was the last to arrive."
    nvl clear
    "Mikuru sat at one side of the table, opposite Yuki. Koizumi sat between them, his eternal smile faded to half its normal strength. Kyon himself stood next to her � he was the one who had answered the intercom and let her in. She narrowed her eyes at him and kicked her shoes off, storming into the room to Yuki's side and immediately pressing one palm onto the smaller girl's forehead. \"You don't feel feverish,\" she finally commented. \"But if you're sick, you shouldn't be up and about anyway.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Not sick,\" Yuki answered. When Haruhi turned to Kyon and scowled at him, she corrected, \"Dying.\""
    "Her irritation at Kyon's practical joke momentarily blew away, like settled dust being disturbed. \"Dying!?\" she yelped, turning to stare at the smaller girl. \"What of? How?\""
    "Yuki blinked twice, then answered, \"I am not able to say.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Mikuru?\""
    "\"Um ... classified.\""
    "She scowled at Koizumi, daring him to be a defiant annoyance, too. \"I don't know,\" he said, looking embarrassed and flustered."
    "Turning around, she glared at Kyon, letting her irritation return and focus on him full-force. \"I am not in the mood for pranks!\" she snapped. \"This better not be a joke!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I wish it was,\" he said back crossly, and she found herself taken aback at the force in his tone. She had a mental catalogue of Kyon-like behaviors, and this fell firmly into the category of the seldom-seen but always feared angry Kyon. Dour, upset, irked, sarcastic, caustic ... sure. But angry?"
    nvl clear
    "Hell, she'd once smashed his head into her desk � entirely on accident � and he was only annoyed. And it wasn't for hitting his head, it was for disrupting a class! Nevermind that he had been dozing off before that."
    nvl clear
    "She'd seen him genuinely angry two times. Only once had it been at her. She hated that memory more than anything else she knew about him, but couldn't dare to forget it. Once it had been at � of all things � his unfinished homework over summer break, though that was the lesser of the two displays; also the first. She didn't understand it, but she knew whatever it was, she wanted to be on his side against it."
    nvl clear
    "Even then, some small part of her really didn't like the way that when he chose to, he simply seized command of her precious hand-crafted Brigade and, no matter how cute it was�"
    "She firmly suplexed that thought into oblivion."
    nvl clear
    "\"Alright,\" she said evenly. \"Tell me what's going on.\""
    "Kyon ran his hands through his hair and began pacing, not looking at her. Good; she wasn't the one who had made him mad."
    "\"Have a seat,\" he said. \"This may take a bit, and I need a promise from you before we start.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I'm not making a blind promise,\" she retorted, though she did take the seat opposite Koizumi, between Mikuru and Yuki. Yuki wordlessly poured her a cup of tea, which she threw back in a single gulp."
    "\"I need you to promise to listen to everything we have to say before leaving,\" he answered."
    nvl clear
    "\"That's stupid,\" she grumbled. \"If Yuki's in danger, what kind of person do you take me for?\" She wasn't that bad about ignoring the needs of her brigade members."
    "\"Even so.\""
    "\"Fine,\" she sighed. \"I promise. Now can you get on with it?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Okay,\" he said, pacing around to the window. \"Almost a year ago � last May � we ended up going on a city search where no one but you and I showed up.\""
    "\"I remember,\" she said, annoyed. A stupid practical joke on his part ... though, it had given her the idea for the movie."
    "\"I told you that aliens, espers, and time travelers really existed, right?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"We're going back to that?\" she asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Really?\""
    "\"Yeah, okay, you remember it, so I don't need to say it again,\" he said with a shrug. \"Koizumi, you promised that if it had to happen, you'd stand next to me when Yuki needed our help. Remember?\""
    "\"Yes,\" the smiling boy said, though his smile had completely vanished. \"As much as it scares me.... Suzumiya-san, Kyon-kun is speaking the truth.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"You're an esper?\" she asked him doubtfully. He gave a solemn nod, and she internalized a sigh. What, was Kyon just acting? Was this is unsubtle way of saying he wanted to be a star in the next movie, not just a camera man? She had to admit, his emotion seemed genuine, but why couldn't he just have asked her? There was an awful lot he could have just asked for, and never bothered to!"
    "That thought was drop-kicked to fly off next to the last banished thought."
    nvl clear
    "\"And, Mikuru, you're a time traveler?\" she asked, idly spinning her teacup on the table before her."
    "\"Um ... that is ... I can't....\""
    "\"Asahina-san,\" Kyon broke in suddenly, \"please ask your supervisor to declassify this for me.\""
    nvl clear
    "Mikuru stared at Kyon, her eyes large and confused. \"Y...yes,\" she agreed, her glance flickering nervously to Haruhi before she pressed a hand against the side of her face, and her eyes became unfocused. They abruptly snapped back into focus, though her expression had become comically bewildered. \"I ... they said yes!? I don't understand! Kyon-kun, how-\""
    nvl clear
    "\"That's ... classified,\" he answered, looking away. \"Anyway, go ahead and explain it to Haruhi.\""
    "\"Oh! Um, Suzumiya-san ... what he says is true! I am a time traveler, though, it's more accurate to say that I'm a visitor from the future who is projected into the past, almost like a two-dimensional image projected into�\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Right, right,\" Haruhi cut her off. \"You're a time traveler. Understood.\" Though, Mikuru's acting skills had picked up quite a bit, too.... This better not be a ploy to make Kyon the male lead opposite Mikuru in the next movie! Saving that thought for later, she turned her gaze to Yuki. \"And you're an alien?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"The function allowing me to confirm or deny that data has been denied at this juncture in time,\" she answered. Turning to Kyon, she added, \"One hour and twenty minutes remain.\""
    "He bit off a curse, running his hands through his hair. Haruhi was taken aback again ... he obviously didn't like getting bad grades or doing poorly on exams, but he almost never got this stressed about things. This was starting to become unnerving."
    nvl clear
    "\"Okay,\" she said, before he could speak. \"Look, this has gone far enough. I get it, alright? Your practical joke ... okay. Fine. What are you really after? Producer? Co-director? You want to help write the script for the next movie? Let's just cut to the chase � this isn't really fun, especially since it's at my expense!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"At your expense�\" That had done it, she realized, flinching back. Now some of his anger was directed at her, though he quickly controlled it, smacking one palm against his face. \"Last May,\" he said, \"you came to class with your hair in a ponytail.\""
    "She suddenly couldn't meet his eyes, and a previously suplexed thought began to climb back into her awareness."
    nvl clear
    "\"It was hot!\" she said defensively. \"What of it?\""
    "\"You had a dream � a nightmare � that night,\" he added."
    "\"So?\" She forced her heartbeat to still. She'd told him that much, why wouldn't he remember? She did, after all, even now."
    nvl clear
    "\"So, in your dream, you watched giant blue creatures smash apart the school, and you were very excited about abandoning the Brigade � your friends � and leading an exciting new life in whatever world was to come.\" Koizumi looked uncomfortable. Mikuru's face turned red, and she began studying the bottom of her teacup intently. Yuki merely stared at her, unblinking."
    "\"I never told anyone that,\" she mumbled."
    nvl clear
    "\"In the end, I told you that I wanted to come back to this world,\" Kyon said. \"That it was more interesting than you realized. Do I have to say what I did to wake you up?\""
    "She felt her face color. \"N...no,\" she managed. \"Who� No, what are you?\""
    "\"I am a normal person,\" he told her, shrugging. \"I happen to have traveled to parallel worlds. I have traveled through time. I've seen some amazing things ... but through it all, I always come back here to be with my friends.\""
    nvl clear
    "It was getting very strange, and she didn't know why, but the conversation was starting to make her uncomfortable. Maybe the knowledge of her dream was just an expert analysis based on her personality? The refusal to mention the kiss specifically was because they didn't know? But she wasn't certain she wanted to hear him say it was a kiss, here, right now...."
    nvl clear
    "And she'd promised she would listen. \"You're claiming that you're a slider?\" she asked, blinking, buying herself some time to think."
    "He was momentarily startled by the question, then exchanged a glance with Koizumi, who shrugged. \"Actually, Kyon-kun, you may be,\" the supposed esper said, smiling. \"That would explain why one never seemed to appear; it was you!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Nevermind that!\" he said quickly, shaking his head. \"Haruhi, there's something I have to tell you, something I think will make you believe me.\""
    "\"What's that?\" She couldn't think of anything else to say or ask."
    nvl clear
    "\"Tanabata last year was the first time I traveled back in time,\" he began, his expression solemn. \"I went to a night three years earlier. That would be Tanabata four years ago. While I was there, I was sent to East Middle school, carrying Asahina-san on my back.\""
    "\"Y...you're...\" she gasped, her eyes widening as the world around her spun, the amazing, simultaneously horrifying and delightful realization that he was speaking the truth was making her dizzy."
    nvl clear
    "\"And I met a younger version of yourself, and wrote the message, 'I am here' on the school grounds, following your instructions. You asked who I was, and I told you that I went by ... John Smith.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"You're John Smith!\" She wasn't aware of getting up from the table, uncertain if she had moved around or just jumped over it � she just knew that she had flung herself at him, tackling him to the floor and grabbing on tightly. \"I knew it!\" she yelled. \"I knew I'd find you again!\""

    "Kyon hadn't had time to think about things before. Part of that was from a certainty that if he had let himself think about things, it could easily become too late to do anything. Part of it was his desire to make sure he could find his way back to his own world. But most of it was the fact that he could deal with the world going away, as long as he could keep the Brigade intact, regardless of his position in it."
    "Though, that thought in mind, when he awoke, he stared out the window after rising before his younger sister yet again. This habit was probably going to wear him out, he thought. Still, by the time he had finished washing up, just in time to watch her prance out of her room, he couldn't help but smile. Her face fell when she realized that the era of deadly wake-up elbow-slams was probably at an end."
    "He busied himself making breakfast while mulling over the likely consequences of his impulsive decision. And there would be consequences, he had no doubts of that at all."
    "Serving his curious sister a piece of toast with a fried egg on it, he set about preparing one for himself. Now Haruhi, as she understood it, believed that she could change reality...."
    "\"But you're saying, I have a power I don't even know about?\" Haruhi asked, now pacing anxiously back and forth. \"Why would you have kept this a secret from me?! Even more than the fact that you're the people I've been looking for, the fact that I can do things!\" She looked on the verge of tears and laughter at the same time."
    "\"That was the decision of my superiors,\" Koizumi offered, frowning. \"It was believed that ... there could be unfortunate consequences.\""
    "\"And you,\" she continued, peering at Mikuru, \"also followed your instructions?\""
    "\"U...um,\" Mikuru said, shrinking into herself slightly. \"I...it's not a matter of choice for me ... literally, I can't talk about classified information when it's classified. If I try to, then classified info�\" She hung her head with a weary sigh. \"Sorry.\""
    "\"And you?\" she pressed, turning her gaze to Yuki, who sat at the table, staring at the teacups."
    "\"Focus is on preventing my imminent deletion,\" the interface finally answered. \"Limited resources.\""
    "\"So, all along, the lowliest ranking member of the SOS Brigade is the only one who ever actually tried to tell me the truth,\" Haruhi grumbled."
    "\"That aside,\" Kyon said, shifting his shoulders, \"we can talk about this later. I'm sorry, but I'm really worried about Nagato. Since you believe us, or at least, I think you do�\""
    "\"I don't,\" she countered. \"I believe you. Because you tried. But....\" She trailed off and shrugged, gesturing to the other three. \"The people who wormed their way into my good graces were working against me! How can I trust them?\""
    "Mikuru said nothing, just sniffling as tears trickled down her cheeks. Koizumi's eternal smile had withered to a pained shadow of its normal impenetrability. Yuki continued staring at her."
    "\"Because I do,\" Kyon said, breaking the uncomfortable silence. \"I don't know if we can believe everything, but I know that Nagato is a humanoid interface. I've traveled through time with Asahina-san. Koizumi's shown me the places where he and the other espers of his kind fight.... And in every case, all three of them couldn't tell you because their bosses told them not to.\""
    "\"What about your boss,\" she snapped, turning to eye Kyon with suspicion. \"What does that person say?\""
    "\"Right now she's asking me if she has any reason to trust her closest friends,\" he answered. \"And I'm begging her to, because that may be the only way to save Nagato's life.\""
    "\"I.... I'm your boss?\" she asked, narrowing her eyes in suspicion. \"You don't work for anyone else?\""
    "\"Thankfully,\" he agreed, nodding. \"I suppose I have done things for Asahina-san and her superiors. I know my actions have benefited Koizumi's Organization. But I've only ever done things because I felt it was important for you, or for the sake of the entire world.\""
    "\"The entire world?\" she pressed, struggling to contain all the new information. \"You've saved the world?\""
    "\"Technically, you did,\" he said, shaking his head. \"I just convinced you to do it ... but we already went over that.\""
    "\"So you're some kind of undercover hero without any of his own special abilities that fights to take care of me, and to save the world?\" she asked."
    "\"Yes,\" Mikuru said quickly, nodding. \"He absolutely does! I don't know if you'll believe me, but it's the truth!\""
    "\"When this reality was overwritten with a reality where you had no powers, and none of our factions existed,\" Yuki contributed suddenly, \"he found a way to restore this reality once more, actually creating a parallel universe.\""
    "\"Then I'll believe that,\" she allowed, as strange as it seemed. But he must be ... it made sense that John Smith was Kyon if he was a normal person who called in favors from others. But still.... \"Okay. Things are going to change, right now. Kyon, you want me to save Yuki, right?\""
    "\"You mean, you don't?\" he asked, aghast."
    "She winced. \"Of course I do! But I want your opinion!\""
    "\"Absolutely! Haven't I been clear enough!?\""
    "\"Okay, then,\" Haruhi decided. \"But no more running around behind my back! Anyone who can't do this is out of the Brigade. Everyone who really wants to help me out, and stay in the Brigade ... everyone who wants to prove to me that this is true and earn my forgiveness for the whole stupid masquerade ... has to accept me as a boss, just like Kyon!\""
    "She nodded decisively, then her eyes widened slightly in realization. \"Oh, and Koizumi? You're demoted. Kyon's obviously more trustworthy as a vice commander, since you already report to him anyway. Everyone got it? We're the bosses � not your 'Organizations' or 'Thought Entities' or mysterious future 'superiors' who somehow control your minds!\""
    "\"Understood,\" Yuki replied quietly. \"Permissions change indexed. Awaiting transfer.\""
    "\"I promised this already,\" Koizumi agreed shakily. \"Very well.\""
    "\"I.... I can't,\" Mikuru whimpered. \"I'm not even allowed to try! Oh, Suzumiya-san, I would, but I can't�\" Mikuru's eyes widened as she looked up, blinking away her tears. \"I ... I'm getting a message?\" she asked. \"I ... I am allowed to do whatever Kyon-kun asks? B...but not you? I don't understand! I'm sorry, those are just my instructions!\""
    "\"Well, fine,\" Haruhi grumbled, narrowing her eyes. \"I can trust him.\""
    "\"Right,\" Kyon said, looking at the interface at the table. \"Nagato, how much time is left?\""
    "\"Thirty two minutes, fifteen seconds,\" she said."
    "\"So ... how do we do this?\" Haruhi asked, biting her lip. \"How do I use my power?\""
    "\"Your power is very dangerous,\" Kyon warned her. \"If it's used incorrectly, you might accidentally destroy the universe. But Nagato can use that power safely. So, my idea is that you can become her boss and replace the Integrated Data Sentience Entity for her, and hopefully we won't have to destroy them. If we have to, then they have to go � that's all there is to it. But if we can avoid that ... well. Nagato, can you do what I'm thinking of?\""
    "Yuki blinked several times, then said, \"A memetic link can be formed between myself and Suzumiya Haruhi, such that all created data is cached within an internal buffer for analysis to await approval or disapproval. This will require the permissions of Suzumiya Haruhi, and an additional password carrier.\" Her eyes fixed on Kyon. \"That carrier shall be you. Is this acceptable?\""
    "\"If that's how it has to be done,\" Haruhi agreed with a shrug. \"I don't want you to die, Yuki.... Kyon?\""
    "\"Yeah,\" he said, nodding quickly. \"Let's do it.\""
    "Rising from her seat, the smaller girl reached both hands out and placed her fingertips across the sides of Haruhi's head. \"Link established,\" she declared after a minute of silent staring into the taller girl's eyes. \"Awaiting data creation.\""
    "\"Data creation?\" Haruhi asked, frowning. \"What does that mean exactly?\""
    "\"It has to do with how ... what she is views our world,\" Koizumi supplied helpfully. \"From our point of view, think of it as the ability to create new aspects of reality. I believe she is prepared for you to try and use your powers.\""
    "\"Yeah, but ... how do I do that?\""
    "\"Try and believe something,\" Kyon suggested. \"Believe that Yuki is going to be fine, and will report to you from now on.\""
    "Haruhi shifted her gaze to the smaller girl before her, then took a deep breath and closed her eyes, concentrating. \"Yuki works for me,\" she muttered. \"She's a real alien ... but she's going to break away from her bosses and work for me....\""
    "\"Program loaded,\" Yuki said. Turning her eyes to Kyon, she asked, \"Permission to proceed?\""
    "\"Granted,\" he said without hesitation."
    "After finishing his breakfast and heading to school, he was startled to run into Haruhi at the train station at the bottom of the hill � literally. The girl shot out from behind one of the pillars supporting the heavy structure keeping rainwater off the train platform, nearly plowing him over as she launched herself, arms wrapping around him as she swung around with her momentum, crying out, \"YES!\""
    "Struggling and only barely managing to keep his balance, he eyed all of the other Kitago students around them, watching with raised eyebrows and open smirks. \"Hey,\" he managed, remembering his new role as the vice commander, and everything they had discussed the previous night. \"What's going on?\""
    "She released him with a huge grin. \"Yesterday, after I went home, was so cool!\" she squealed. \"I never knew you could do all those things! I mean, I suspected, since you were the best member of the Brigade next to myself and everything, but that was amazing!\""
    "Her smile not fading in the slightest, she handed him an envelope, the seal already broken. \"You said I should give this to you,\" she added. \"You said to put it in your shoe locker, but why wait? What's so great about messages in shoe lockers?\""
    "\"They pretty much never go well for me,\" he sighed, taking the envelope and eyeing the broken seal. It was just a sticker, something that looked like it might have been stolen from one of his sister's collections. \"You opened it already, I see.\""
    "\"Well, of course! Doesn't make any sense to me, though. I probably wouldn't have opened it if you hadn't told me it wouldn't make any sense to me. Why did you want me to give you a letter from yourself, though?\""
    "The skies were clear of rain, if gray, so he sighed and pulled the letter out of the envelope while proceeding up the hill. \"I'm guessing,\" he said mildly, \"that since I just went home last night, I'm going to be time traveling back to yesterday relatively soon.\""
    "\"Hmm...\" she mused, considering. \"Can I go with you?\""
    "\"'No she can't',\" he quoted the first line of the note, scrawled hastily in his own handwriting. \"Well, seems that future me is a bit of a smart-ass.\""
    "\"Humph! I could have told you that.\""
    "He eyed her, then shook his head. He'd brought this upon himself. Maybe, with luck, Nagato could act as a controlling agent and keep Haruhi in line. Maybe, he told himself. If this was what it took to save Nagato...."
