    "Kyon leapt out of bed with a handspring, landing in a crouch before the opening door and lunging instantly into the forbidden little-sister-submission-tickle-strike, completely foiling her attempt to sneak in and wake him up first. Only after he had reduced her to a shrieking, laughing pile, and his mother was tiredly staring up at the pair of them from the bottom of the stairs did he relent."

    "\"Hmm,\" he mused, his smile fading as his dream and the vague, uncertain memory of Yuki's 'training' session replayed themselves in his mind. The training was a headache, and he had thought oddly draining.... Maybe Yuki just hadn't perfected it, the first time? Even so, it was hard to grin when he considered what Haruhi might have done to herself that night."

    "She woke up, staring at the ceiling of her room and blinking. She'd had a dream.... She knew it was important, but the details kept slipping just out of her reach. She got out of bed and went about her morning routine, concentrating on the hazy recollections. Kyon was there ... and it was at school."
    "Something had been different about it, she was certain, but all she could remember was the kiss. And she'd had {i}that{/i} dream before. Before Kyon's revelation to her that she had a power. Remembering that she could do such things, and ensuring no parents were around to witness it, she closed one eye and pointed at a toothbrush, pleased as it wobbled unsteadily out of the holder and drifted to her hand."

    "Good, she thought. {i}That{/i} hadn't been a dream ... even if kissing Kyon had been. She felt her face warm up as she remembered the conversation she had with Yuki and Mikuru the day before. Even Kanae had some input, despite her relative newness to the group."
    "\"I said I'd help him with his homework,\" she realized aloud, hurrying her pace and rushing to the kitchen. No parents around, still, which was good for today. That meant she could cheat. He always gave her a long-suffering sigh and mumbled about responsibility when she did, but what he didn't know, he couldn't whine about."

    "So, under her dutiful eye, she watched utensils and ingredients dance across the kitchen, laboring as intently as a quartet of herself ... or a single eight-armed girl, she supposed, but that thought caused her control to wander. Focusing more intently, she watched as preparations finished, then spent an annoying ten minutes combing through every cupboard and pantry door in the house until she found her old bento and the spare. \"He'd better appreciate this,\" she mumbled, wrapping them both after packing them unreasonably full."
    "That done, she tucked the packages into her bag and settled on stuffing the remaining portion of rice and assorted bento ingredients into a single tupperware. Inelegant, but she could eat while drilling him on his homework. She hurried out the door and to school."

    "She fought to keep her face from coloring, and quickly jogged past him so he couldn't see her expression. \"Wouldn't {i}you{/i} like to know,\" she said with a chuckle. \"Come on, let's study in the club room.\""
