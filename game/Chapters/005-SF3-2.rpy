Only after he had reduced her to a shrieking, laughing pile, and his mother was tiredly staring up at the pair of them from the bottom of the stairs did he relent."

The training was a headache, and he had thought oddly draining.... Maybe Yuki just hadn't perfected it, the first time? Even so, it was hard to grin when he considered what Haruhi might have done to herself that night."

    "She woke up, staring at the ceiling of her room and blinking. She'd had a dream.... She knew it was important, but the details kept slipping just out of her reach. She got out of bed and went about her morning routine, concentrating on the hazy recollections. Kyon was there ... and it was at school."
    "Something had been different about it, she was certain, but all she could remember was the kiss. And she'd had {i}that{/i} dream before. Before Kyon's revelation to her that she had a power. Remembering that she could do such things, and ensuring no parents were around to witness it, she closed one eye and pointed at a toothbrush, pleased as it wobbled unsteadily out of the holder and drifted to her hand."    
    nvl clear
    "Good, she thought. {i}That{/i} hadn't been a dream ... even if kissing Kyon had been. She felt her face warm up as she remembered the conversation she had with Yuki and Mikuru the day before. Even Kanae had some input, despite her relative newness to the group."
    "\"I said I'd help him with his homework,\" she realized aloud, hurrying her pace and rushing to the kitchen. No parents around, still, which was good for today. That meant she could cheat. He always gave her a long-suffering sigh and mumbled about responsibility when she did, but what he didn't know, he couldn't whine about."
    nvl clear
    "So, under her dutiful eye, she watched utensils and ingredients dance across the kitchen, laboring as intently as a quartet of herself ... or a single eight-armed girl, she supposed, but that thought caused her control to wander. Focusing more intently, she watched as preparations finished, then spent an annoying ten minutes combing through every cupboard and pantry door in the house until she found her old bento and the spare. \"He'd better appreciate this,\" she mumbled, wrapping them both after packing them unreasonably full."
    "That done, she tucked the packages into her bag and settled on stuffing the remaining portion of rice and assorted bento ingredients into a single tupperware. Inelegant, but she could eat while drilling him on his homework. She hurried out the door and to school."

    "She nodded dubiously, then turned around and put something in the club room's mini-fridge. He flipped through the history notes she had written, paying special attention to where she had underlined specific dates or names. History was defeated quickly, thanks to the accuracy of Haruhi's notes, and the sketchy grammar notes she had left were more than enough to bolster his own knowledge in that regard. It may not have been much, but at least he had one good subject...."

    "\"Sure thing,\" he agreed, finishing up the last few lines he needed before he was done. \"Lucky there's no essay,\" he added, clenching and unclenching his right hand to relieve the writer's cramp he'd started to develop. After a glance at the clock, he started packing his homework and the notes Haruhi had made for him into his schoolbag. \"But, seriously Haruhi ... thanks for helping me out with my homework.\""

Yuki's average was only short of being perfect by the four percent of answers she simply didn't bother completing. Mikuru struggled for her grades, but diligently did her homework despite brigade duties." 
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi, naturally, was Haruhi. So he had no real excuse for poor grades except for being unintelligent. His head sank, considering that. He couldn't even think to try and seek solace in Kanae's grades, whatever they were. It just didn't seem right to judge himself against an underclassman."

    "She fell silent at the sight of the classroom, all other students already seated, glancing over their shoulders at the pair. Everyone quickly looked away, though at a glance, Okabe-sensei hadn't arrived yet either. Shrugging, Kyon closed the door after Haruhi stepped through and went to his desk."
    "\"Anyway,\" Haruhi continued in a semi-hushed tone, eyeing the other students in the room, \"what's going on, here?\""
    "\"No idea,\" he tossed back just as quietly. His eyes scanned across Kunikida and Taniguchi, but both of them kept their eyes oriented directly forward. \"Seems a bit odd, though.\""
    "\"Eh,\" Haruhi mused, tapping a fingertip on her desk thoughtfully. \"Well, I'm sure it's nothing ... probably.\""
