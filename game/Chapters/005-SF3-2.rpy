    "Kyon leapt out of bed with a handspring, landing in a crouch before the opening door and lunging instantly into the forbidden little-sister-submission-tickle-strike, completely foiling her attempt to sneak in and wake him up first. Only after he had reduced her to a shrieking, laughing pile, and his mother was tiredly staring up at the pair of them from the bottom of the stairs did he relent."

    "\"When you wake up with as much energy as I do,\" he told her sternly, \"no surprise attack is going to be effective enough.\" "

    "\"Hmm,\" he mused, his smile fading as his dream and the vague, uncertain memory of Yuki's 'training' session replayed themselves in his mind. The training was a headache, and he had thought oddly draining.... Maybe Yuki just hadn't perfected it, the first time? Even so, it was hard to grin when he considered what Haruhi might have done to herself that night."
